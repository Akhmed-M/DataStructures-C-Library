# DataStructures-C-Library
* To ensure generalization & storing different data-types within the DataStructures, there exists in every folder a subfolder called ***Types(variable)*** that allows you to `choose a data-type` OR `make your own`
* Most imports are imports from c-files, so I do not have to keep linking header files to source files everytime a change occurs due to testing. However I will update the library to import header files (later).
* If anything did not work correctly please leave a comment or contact me
